# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. 

# About me
My name is Daniel Cortes and I make things happen!
Although the popular saying goes, "If life gives you lemons, make lemonade," my perspective leans more towards: "Do not wait for life to give you lemons, go out and find them."
 
The entertainment industry is undoubtedly the passion that fuels my goals. This is why itâ€™s no surprise that I am currently pursuing the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. Contributing with my technical and interpersonal skills to an industry that moves millions of people is, and will continue to be for many years, the reason why I make things happen.

# What I hope to learn
I am exited to learn about:

1. Thinking outsite the box for data visualization
2. Telling impacful and useful stories with data
3. Graphic desing techniques to improve my visuals
4. Know useful programas as tablue for dashboards optimization and automatization
My goal is to better convey financial information or business pitches through my visualizations. After all, I believe what we all seek is for our work to have a meaningful impact. ðŸ˜Š

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.
