# About me
My name is Daniel Cortes and I make things happen!
Although the popular saying goes, "If life gives you lemons, make lemonade," my perspective leans more towards: "Do not wait for life to give you lemons, go out and find them."
 
The entertainment industry is undoubtedly the passion that fuels my goals. This is why itâ€™s no surprise that I am currently pursuing the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. Contributing with my technical and interpersonal skills to an industry that moves millions of people is, and will continue to be for many years, the reason why I make things happen.

# What I hope to learn
I am exited to learn about:

1. Thinking outsite the box for data visualization
2. Telling impacful and useful stories with data
3. Graphic desing techniques to improve my visuals
4. Know useful programas as tablue for dashboards optimization and automatization
My goal is to better convey financial information or business pitches through my visualizations. After all, I believe what we all seek is for our work to have a meaningful impact. ðŸ˜Š
