# Title
Critique by Desing #2

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/wzx70h/average_age_of_women_at_first_marriage_by_state/

I chose this visualization because it compares three variables in a simple way, allowing us to get an idea of the story it aims to tell. It clearly presents a presumed relationship between the state, the average population density per mile, and the average age of marriage for women.

Although the graph does not explicitly show it, the data also includes two evaluation periods or timeframes: 2005–2010 and 2015–2019.

Overall, the visualization is easy for users to understand. During the interview process, it became clear that one of the issues with the graph is that the timeframe of the data is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the reliability of the information is questionable, given that the original source is a Reddit post. I do not have access to the primary source of the data, so I will continue working with this source.

Regarding the original graph and the critique methodology, I find that while the visualization is simple, it effectively conveys the message. I agree that it is important to consider the timeframe of the displayed data, and I would make the following changes:

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

- Add the names of the states.
- Split the information into two graphs: one covering the timeframe from 2005 to 2010 and another from 2015 to 2019.
- Change the color of the spheres to a shade commonly associated with the female gender, such as fuchsia.
- Remove the yellow background from the labels.
- Reduce the contrast of the background grid lines in the graph.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

My first sketch was in tablue, and I did a map,  that even if it looks nice, I don't think that it shows what the message is

My second option, is to replicate what it works for the otiginal desing, and add  the second time frame, chage the colors and addd the name of the state. I  think thoese elements works to simply the understanding of the reader.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
