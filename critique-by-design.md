# Critique by Desing #2

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

Original:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d467e4-1c0c-4339-a2b8-ada663a248da)
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/wzx70h/average_age_of_women_at_first_marriage_by_state/


I chose this visualization because it compares three variables in a simple way, allowing us to get an idea of the story it aims to tell. It clearly presents a presumed relationship between the state, the average population density per mile, and the average age of marriage for women.

Although the graph does not explicitly show it, the data also includes two evaluation periods or timeframes: 2005–2010 and 2015–2019.

Overall, the visualization is easy for users to understand. During the interview process, it became clear that one of the issues with the graph is that the timeframe of the data is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the reliability of the information is questionable, given that the original source is a Reddit post. I do not have access to the primary source of the data, so I will continue working with this source.

Regarding the original graph and the critique methodology, I find that while the visualization is simple, it effectively conveys the message.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

Summarize changes:
- Add the names of the states.
- Split the information into two graphs: one covering the timeframe from 2005 to 2010 and another from 2015 to 2019.
- Change the color of the spheres to a shade commonly associated with the female gender, such as fuchsia.
- Remove the yellow background from the labels.
- Reduce the contrast of the background grid lines in the graph.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

My first sketch was in tablue, and I did a map,  that even if it looks nice, I don't think that it shows what the message is

My second option, is to replicate what it works for the otiginal desing, and add  the second time frame, chage the colors and addd the name of the state. I  think thoese elements works to simply the understanding of the reader.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | MSPPM First Year Student | MEIM First Year Student |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|   Can you tell me what you think this is?       | Showing the map and the table is the average age of first marriage by state             | The average age of marriage by state. I guess the color represent the population density. The darkerst it is the more populate the state is?             |
|   Can you describe to me what this is telling you?       | This is telling me that on average the marriage age for women in the U.S is around  the 27 years old. It is doesnt really tell me much at first sight             | It is telling me that Massachussets and Rhode Island have the highest density of population in the country. I can't see very well the numbers. In the second graph I can clearly identify the relation between the population densityh and the age of marriage. I can see the trend.             |
|   Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?       | In the second graph the trend is pretty clear. I don't know about the source of the data but the graph is telling me that the bigger the population density, the highest the average age of the first marriage for women. Makes sense to me though.             | This two variables are not usually presented together, so it is quite surprising see the results of the data. Even in the changes between the two time frames are not material, I can see the relation between the two variables. It is only confirm the trend and the story behid the data.             |
|   Who do you think is the intended audience for this?       | I this it could be fertility policy makers or policy makers in general            | Maybe sociologiest who study the increasing age in marriage in the U.S. Or maybe conservatives political groups too, beacuase if women are getting marriage later, maybe they are not thinking about having soon, and that is something that usually are in the agenda of political parties.             |
|   Is there anything you would change or do differently?       | Could you not repeat under the labels? In general I see it very clear. I would not use the map graph, the second one is way more clear.             | I would change how the title is frame, and I would highlighted the lables of the ages. I  think  those are important changes.              |

Synthesis: 
1. Use the second sketch as the solution. Change the avg age interval
2. Change the tittle
3. Bold the labels

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

A map proposal, although it seemed like a good idea, didn’t really tell the story that the initial graph aimed to convey. In redesigning, it’s important to maintain the author’s intent as the main focus, regardless of whether the changes are significant or far from the original design. If the initial design works well, the changes in the redesign can be minimal and still be useful.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

The changes from the second solution to the final solution were minimal. As I mentioned, the idea was clear from the original graph, and the changes to make the reading even quicker and clearer were minimal. I changed the color to help the reader naturally associate the figures with the female population, added a comparison of the two time frames provided by the dataset, and included the state names for clarity. Visually, it is also a cleaner visualization.
