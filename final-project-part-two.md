# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

Building on the outline from the previous submission and with the help of the interview and feedback sessions in class, I have been able to refine key aspects of my project's storytelling. This includes thinked about the story telling around Set Up, Conflict, and Resolution structure, identifying important data visualization ideas for the audience, and narrowing down the themes I want to explore.

Here you can find my sketches in the Shorthand presentation

# General Outline
I have decided to structure my outline around the following points:

1. Current situation of the streaming market regarding international and non-English productions.
2. Emphasis on Netflix’s success story, as it holds the most-watched production in recent streaming history. I will also do a zoom-in on one production per continent.
3. Discussion on the costs of implementing international productions and the production model, using Netflix’s business case as a reference.
4. Overview of different tax incentives, highlighting countries that have successfully attracted foreign investment through the audiovisual industry.
5. Finally, I will emphasize the idea that streaming should be as global as storytelling itself. The goal is to leave the audience with a call to action, encouraging streaming companies to invest more in international and non-English original productions.

# User research 

## Target audience
> My audience will be content teams within streaming companies in North America (Apple TV+, Amazon, and Disney). Broadly speaking, it is a competitive analysis, but with the intention of driving a change in how original content is produced for streaming in the United States today. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Know if the sections are well connected and the information is clear |As a producer, what information do you find relevant when evaluating a project?|
|I want to know if the charts are clear| What is the first message that comes to mind when looking at this chart?|
|Know if the message is clear| After reviewing the full report, what do you think should be the next steps?|
|Know if the information is complete | There is any additional information that you might add?|

| Questions               | Interview 1 (MEIM student  - mid 20s) | MAM students - mid 20s | MAM student 25 years old |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|All interviewed roled as managing producers for a streaming company|
| As a producer, what information do you find relevant when evaluating a project? | Insightful feedback |I would focus on logistical costs, production costs, and distribution costs. It's also important to look at the market and production timelines, as these can increase costs. I’m also interested in knowing if the market is oversaturated. |It's important to know the team and the target audience. For me, it’s essential to understand the story, the costs, and the partnerships. What will the production periods be? | It's necessary to know the team behind the production. Whether the artistic and creative team is well-known or if it’s a new venture to assess the risks and costs.
|What is the first message that comes to mind when looking at this chart?                         | Although the boxes are small, and the design needs a lot of work, the information is clear. It’s important to consolidate a single color palette. I liked the bar chart showing views by week. | Squid Game is by far the most-watched series on Netflix. It’s a success story. There are also other international series on the list. The pie chart shows that the U.S. market is competitive. Keep working on the design and usability. | There are many international partners willing to work within the budget. Squid Game has been the most successful series on Netflix. There are many countries offering tax incentives. 
|After reviewing the full report, what do you think should be the next steps? |The goal is to set up an international product committee. Contact the local producer that interests us most.| The goal is to open new international markets and also benefit local economies. The idea is to compete with Netflix and gain more market share. | The goal would be to invest in international content.|
|There is any additional information that you might add? | It’s important to have the information on tax incentives for each country. I know this is a work in progress. | Is there any information related to return on investment? It’s necessary to work on defining a color palette.| For me, the information is complete. Just focus on the design.

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

This is only the sketch for part II but for part III I have a lot of work in desing and in summarize the information in a engaging way.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a color palette that follows throughout the report | Unify the colors of the charts wherever possible  |
| Make the report more interactive           | Include visualizations directly from Tableau                 |
| Improve the usability of the report      | Work on understanding the sections of Shorthand                             |
|The report lacks information        | Strengthen the research and the information in the report                         |
|Need to add references and sources to the report|

> I need to watch every tutorial of Shorthand that I can find.
