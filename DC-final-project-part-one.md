# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 

As global as stories are, streaming platforms should be global too. Successful cases at Netflix, such as Squid Game (South Korea), Money Heist (Spain), and Dark (Germany), have shown that non-North American productions can captivate audiences worldwide, proving that the world is eager for new perspectives.

I want to highlight why investing in international content should be a key part of streaming platforms' business models. Data shows that investing in local productions not only benefits the local market but also brings these foreign realities to global audiences who are eager to experience them.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

My goal is to present data-driven evidence showing that encouraging international productions, outside the U.S., is not only a valuable way to preserve culture and introduce diverse perspectives on how stories are told, and the world is seen, but also a profitable economic decision in an era where access to content is becoming increasingly democratic.

I will begin by engaging the audience with data on widely recognized productions and demonstrating how they have been resounding successes, as reflected in Netflix's publicly shared figures. This data will de audiences, quantity of seasons, production budget and possible return of investments for Netflix. 
Next, I will present data highlighting how other platforms, such as Amazon Prime and Apple TV+, have not invested as heavily in local productions as Netflix. Instead, they have primarily focused on producing and capitalizing well-established franchises and intellectual properties, such as Star Wars and Marvel Comics.

While there have been outstanding U.S. productions that have received both critical and audience acclaim, such as House of Cards, Stranger Things, and Better Call Saul, I will also use data to illustrate how Netflixâ€™s international productions, outside the United States, have solidified its position as a leader in the streaming market.
On the other side, the fact that a production is local or made outside the United States does not automatically guarantee success or even a compelling story. 

However, fostering local production and securing the backing of major studios or streaming platforms gradually creates opportunities for these local stories that deserve to be told to be produced. For a platform like Amazon Prime, what may seem like a small investment could mean the opportunity for a local filmmaker to bring a great story to the world with top-tier audiovisual quality. Beyond the cultural impact of these seed investments, they also have the potential to generate significant financial returns for streaming platforms.

Finally, I will encourage the audience to be more critical of the content we consume and to recognize how our actions as viewers influence whether major studios and streaming platforms invest more or less in local productions. One way to be critical is by actively supporting local content: watching, sharing, and discussing it within our circles, as well as advocating international productions that resonate with us on a deep level. This, in turn, will help open the doors to new narratives and perspectives.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

Netflix has a lot of data that I can use to show runtime per show, numbers of weeks in the global top 10, and Hours Viewed.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

My initial idea is to gather data from publicly available company sources, such as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+. Examples of such sources are listed below.

https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv-non-english - Netflix top 10 non-english productions

https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx - Netflix financial reports

https://ir.aboutamazon.com/overview/default.aspx - Amazon Financial reports (in the financial reports, I'm hoping to find an specific segment for Amazon Prime business)

https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/investor-relations/ - Disney Financial reports (in the financial reports, I'm hoping to find an specific segment for Disney + business)

https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx - Apple Financial reports

I also can use external reports about streaming platforms, as the ones cited below:

https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/streaming-services-report/#:~:text=Netflix%20(47%25)%20is%20the,Disney%20Plus%20(23%25) - Streaming market data

https://deadline.com/2024/12/streaming-report-card-2024-1236208785/ - Streaming market general context for 2025

https://www.cloudwards.net/streaming-services-statistics/ - Streaming services general statistics

At the moment, I do not have yet the final thoughts about what data to use, so that is why I am not cite them propertly for now. 

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

For now, I plan to use Tableau as the primary tool to complete my final project. I am eager to explore other tools I will learn during the second half of the mini-course, which will help me enhance my final project.
