# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Even though I already had most of the outline done for Part II, I was able to improve certain aspects of my final project based on my classmates' feedback and the questions raised in class. I also took advantage of the common comments made during my classmates' critiques.

I worked on my call to action as well, which I now feel is clear for producers: "Take the risk of investing in non-English international productions."

The first major change I made was ensuring that all the images I used were 100% copyright-free. One of the methods I used was searching across different platforms, such as Behance, to find illustrations related to the audiovisual productions I wanted to reference without infringing on copyright laws.

I also refined the aesthetics of my visualizations and added relevant information tailored to my target audience. For example, in the section on local production companies, I included their logos, the productions they had worked on, and their respective countries. I also improved the visualization of tax incentives. Initially, I had created an interactive map in Tableau based on the database I had built. While I liked its interactivity, I believe the final version of the map is much clearer and more engaging for the end user.

Finally, in addition to adding another interesting example regarding Netflix’s international success, I worked on refining all my references and sources of information.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My final audience would definitely be television producers outside of Netflix. This could range from analysts to more senior-level producers.
One of the most important insights I gained was the question: "What new information could producers take away from this document?" While part of the research and the project itself is purely communicative, I incorporated highly relevant data, such as the profitability of Squid Game, local providers that could serve as references in different countries, and the tax incentive rates of non-English-speaking countries.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

Regarding design, the biggest change I made between Part II and the final project was making the graphs a bit more subdued. While they might seem flat or dull, I believe they help maintain a consistent visual style throughout the presentation. I used red to highlight key information, and I redesigned the final map to make its message clearer at a glance.

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
> If you used AI to help you complete this assignment (within the parameters of the instruction and course guidelines), detail your use of AI for this assignment here.

For my final project, I only use AI for some research ideas, but I cite them properly in the Shorthand page.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I think one of the main reflections I keep coming back to is how much time design decisions can take. Looking at the entire project as a whole, it might seem simple, but making and executing those design choices took me much longer than expected. I was also fascinated by the wide variety of tools available to make these processes easier and faster.

While I felt that design possibilities in tools like Tableau or even Datawrapper were somewhat limited, I also recognize that this could be due to my own lack of experience with them. I’m sure that if I invested more time practicing in the future, I would discover features I’m not yet aware of that could help with design customization.

Another key takeaway for me is the importance of always starting with the audience in mind and using that as a foundation to create an engaging and useful narrative. Having a clear storytelling approach makes it much easier to streamline the research process, making it more efficient. In general, being clear on this from the start helps guide what to look for and where to find it.
